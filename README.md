# CLIRPNCalculator
Developed a CLI RPN Calculator using Java, developed a stand-alone application to achieve the given problem statement.

1. I choosed stack datastructure to store all the operands and used expression parsing (like postfix or prefix or infix) notation kind of technique to achieve the CLI RPN calculator.
2. I used BufferedReader to read line or given string expression, based on the input if we recieve an numerical operand then we push the data into stack.
3. I we trigger an opearator when we parsing given string then we calculate the output based on the operator unless stack is empty, and then push the result into stack.

As I have spent less time working on it I just focused on achieving solution, if I have given more time to work on this then I would have used advanced level expression parsing techniques and would have worked on improving code quality by diving everything into segments.

As I just created stand-alone application I just used single class to develop entire application, we can just download the source code and run the main method.
